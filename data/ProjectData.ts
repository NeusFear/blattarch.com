    { route: "fam", name: "First Americans Museum", category: ProjectTypes.Government, date: "2021", cover: "entrance.jpg", desc: "First Americans Museum (FAM) celebrates the 39 Native Nations of Oklahoma.  Located on a reclaimed oil field site on the intersection of I-35 and I-40, the project commenced in the late '90s.  The selected design team, Johnson Fain, design architect, and Hornbeek Blatt, co-prime architect, remained constant with the project after several financial delays, finishing construction in 2021.  The design of the 175,000 sq. ft. building/site showcases themes consitent for all tribes and for this reason the building materials are simple: glass, steel, wood and concrete and organized in a series of radial geometries speaking to the spiritual significance of the unending circular forms from which life originates, continues and begins anew.  The site generates from two primary circular forms: earthen and building.  The FAM mound is reminiscent of the prehistoric Spiro mound forms and acts as a solar calendar celebrating the setting sun of the winter solstice thru the concrete west passage, and the setting of the sun of the summer solstice on the mound peak.  At the intersection of the natural and building forms is The Hall of The People, symbolic place of reconciliation between all Peoples.  The museum contains exhibit spaces, multi-purpose theater, cafe, restaurant, classrooms and administration offices."},

As a past automobile dealership, the building was determined to be a contributing structure to the overall historic district. Working with the National Parks Service, as well as the State Historical Preservation Architect, this revitalized facility contains a historically appropriate shell, with a contemporary interior and a roof top terrace space for entertaining. Hornbeek Blatt Architects received an AIA Merit Award from the Central Oklahoma Chapter of the American Institute of Architects for this \"green roof\" design." },

Located in the heart of Edmond, the renovated open lobby and office area is a welcoming and interacting space.  Teller lines with fixed locations were placed with pods that can be addressed from all directions. Loan officers have glass enclosed spaces that look out into the lobby, and loan applications are now made digitally on I-pads as customers and lounge areas throughout the lobby. A cat walk that used to be concealed behind a paneled furred down ceiling over the old teller lines has been exposed and made into an architectural esthetic element. An expansion was made into an older building directly north that was constructed in 1914. An old \"pressed tin\" ceiling and load bearing brick walls were exposed during demolition and both were saved & utilized in the new expansion. Glazing was added in what was once a window-less back area and all support personnel now sit in open spaces where their work effort can take advantage of the natural daylight."},

The spiraling form of the roof, coupled with the complementary form of the Museum, creates a space that embraces the Visitor in a welcoming gesture and dynamically sweeps the eye forward into the masonry East Entrance, the Hall of The People, the Courtyard, and the FAM Mound. Establishing the southern half of the Courtyard, the Visitor Center is an essential part of the two circular forms present on the site, symbolizing both the social and spiritual influences in our world as well as the reconciliation of Nature and Man."},

The property is an adaptive reuse of the historic Ford Motor Company Assembly Plant, and is a contemporary interpretation of the building’s industrial heritage. The 21c Museum Hotel offers 14,000 square feet of contemporary art exhibition space open free of charge to the public. The property’s museum space doubles as meeting and event space, and can accommodate a wide variety of events from board retreats and intimate cocktail parties to a reception-style wedding for 500. The unique circular Main Gallery, and adjoining Gallery 1, is a nimble event space, with velvet drapery, movable partitions and a private full-service bar. As executive architect and teaming with New York-based Design Architect Deborah Berke Partners this project created a contemporary interpretation of the building’s functional form – integrating elements of the automotive and assembly plant legacy throughout. The design takes full advantage of the scale of the original building spaces that are open, light-filled, sculpturally expressive and synonymous with a contemporary art museum."},
