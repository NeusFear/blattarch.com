Located on a reclaimed oil field site on the intersection of I-35 and I-40, the project commenced in the late '90s.  The selected design team, Johnson Fain, design architect, and Hornbeek Blatt, co-prime architect, remained constant with the project after several financial delays, finishing construction in 2021.  The design of the 175,000 sq. ft. building/site showcases themes consitent for all tribes and for this reason the building materials are simple: glass, steel, wood and concrete and organized in a series of radial geometries speaking to the spiritual significance of the unending circular forms from which life originates, continues and begins anew.  The site generates from two primary circular forms: earthen and building.  The FAM mound is reminiscent of the prehistoric Spiro mound forms and acts as a solar calendar celebrating the setting sun of the winter solstice thru the concrete west passage, and the setting of the sun of the summer solstice on the mound peak.  At the intersection of the natural and building forms is The Hall of The People, symbolic place of reconciliation between all Peoples.  The museum contains exhibit spaces, multi-purpose theater, cafe, restaurant, classrooms and administration offices.", images: [fam_entrance, fam_hop, fam_southgallery, fam_touch, fam_walk] },
